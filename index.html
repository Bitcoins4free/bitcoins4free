        <h1>Win 1 Bitcoin Every Month!</h1>
        <p>We are a non-governmental organization (NGO), independent from any government affiliation. Our mission is to support the community by distributing the wealth created through Bitcoin mining and investing.</p>
        <p>Having successfully generated significant profits from Bitcoin mining and strategic investing, we now want to give back to the community. As part of this effort, we’re offering a monthly giveaway of 1 Bitcoin to one lucky participant.</p>
        <p>This is a part of our open-source project designed to foster transparency, collaboration, and financial empowerment in the cryptocurrency space. We aim to create a space where everyone can participate, learn, and grow within the world of digital currencies.</p>
        <p>To enter the giveaway, simply fill out the form below. No government ties, no hidden agenda—just a community-driven initiative to give back.</p>
